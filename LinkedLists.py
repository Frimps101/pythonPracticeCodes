'''
    We use __init__ to initialize a new Element. An Element has some value associated
    with it (which could be anythingâ€”a number, a string, a character, et cetera), and
    it has a variable that points to the next element in the linked list.

            while current.next:

'''
    we're just establishing that a LinkedList is something that has a
    head Element, which is the first element in the list.
    If we establish a new LinkedList without a head, it will default to None

    If the LinkedList already has a head, iterate through the next reference in every Element until you reach the end of the list.
    Set next for the end of the list to be the new_element.
    Alternatively, if there is no head already, you should just assign new_element to it and do nothing else.
